# quiz-code
First I created my web page using HTML;
Then I linked my stylesheet as well as my javascript.js;
Next I began to add classes that I knew I would use CSS to style;
Then I began to add elements such as buttons;
After making buttons and headers, I created an input for users to place their initials;
Next I made many different ID's to reference in my HTML document;
I then began styling my css sheet so that everything looked how I wanted;
After making the CSS sheet I went on to javascript to make my page interactive;
I started by making a list of variables on top to reference in that document later on;
Then I made my array of questions to be displayed as well as corresponding answers and choices;
After that it was time to make the timer to display for the user;
I made the time run out after 1 minute and shuffled the questions;
Then I added some display elements to make my text content display how I wanted it to;
After I made the buttons function, and created a submit button that held scores in the local storage;
Then I created a function to push those scores from the local storage to the display;
After I made an option to restart the quiz as per the guidelines;
Finally I created the page responses to right/wrong answers, and added my eventlistener for the start quiz button.
